# FARMATH

**Farmath** is a farming game where your earnings is determined by the **mathematical expressions** and **your strategy**

## Gameplay

### Core
- Game **starts** with a **basic deck** of cards
- You have to improve the deck as game advances using the **market**
- Each day you draw ***some*** cards
- You can play those cards however you want (excess cards will be sent to **trash**)

### Progression
- Game consistes of 30 day periods
- Each period has a challenge
- Each challenge gives player a permanent helper

### Deck
- Deck exists and can be useable in 2 different ways **(random and sorted)**

### Market
- Everything you bought will be sent to the under of the deck
- 6 items displayed at the market
- Each item can be bought only once in a day (and that creates a daily purchase limit)

### Cards
- Main card type is crops (you can't sow a crop if you don't have a card for it)
- There are also helper cards (Items) 

### Crops
- **6** types of crops
- each crop has some conditions attached to them
- these conditions allow for strategic gameplay
